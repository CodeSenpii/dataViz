Data Visualization Overview 

This visualization is an interactive slideshow which walks the user through gun crime statistics by US state. How high is gun crime across the US - and which states have the worst figures? The violence debate specifically relating to Gun violence has plagued the urban cities for multiple decades and states with larger population often has a high rate of gun crimes and other forms of violence. The reason why I choose this dataset is to bring more awareness that this will continue to be a major problem in the US if the government fails to pass gun reforms because The US has the highest gun ownership rate in the world - there are 89 guns for every 100 Americans, compared to 6 in England and Wales. Moreover, the dataset will show data that I have pulled from 2016-2018 and it will show in detail about murder trends in the United States.


Working with the Dataset
The dataset was about 100 MB in size and the challenge was to converting to excel and clean it and then converting to Json in order to upload the data using D3.Js script and deleting some data that did not show any relevance to the message that I am trying to convey to the user.

ELEMENTS OF NARRATION

Website overview
I used ccs and JavaScript to develop this static site and I chose to do interactive slideshow. Furthermore, I used scroll to transition between each page and I kept the content of the text element the same as far as font size.  Moreover, as you navigate the bar on the right side, the page will transition to each slide which will display the charts that I have selected for my overall project. I have used the following 3 types of charts: MAP, BUBBLE, BAR and tooltips are used on every chart for the user to mouseover and gain significant information on the statistics that I have gathered.
1.	Annotations
Various tooltips, Filters, and labels were used for my data visualization; the charts will show 3 areas where the user can focus based on the filtered year from 2016-2018 for each type of charts as you mouseover, you will discover that the tooltip will give you more insight on the data.
2.	 Parameters & Triggers
The main parameters of this story are total number of murders by state, region, and by the type of weapons for examples handguns has caused a lot more murders than knives and other types of weapons and the tooltips will outline my findings
For the USA Map, I used colors red and filters and tooltips to display the data, the darker the color the greater the total number of murders for example New York and California will have a greater number of murders because their population is greater, and this also goes for the types of weapons that is used to commit crimes, handguns vs robberies are more accessible to these states.

for the Bubble chart Visualization, there are 2 categories total murders which will display all of the states together and as you mouse over the bubble, it will display tool tips with the name of the state and other types of data associated with it and the bigger the bubble the greater the number of murders for that state. Murder by Region is another type which I thought would be interesting to group Northeast, South, Midwest, and West so the user can drill-down deeper.

For the bar Chart Visualization, X and Y axis are properly labeled showing types of weapons that were used and total number of murders relating to these various weapons. I also added filter, so the user can choose between the years 2009-2011. The tooltip will show the 3 states that I have chosen to show the 3 states highest number of murders vs the 3 states with the lowest number of murders on each bar on the chart.



The Gun Crime Dataset 

The latest data from the FBI's uniform crime reports provides a fascinating picture of the use of firearms in crimes across America. The Gun crime dataset really gives in depth information on different types of crimes which involved: Handgun, Rifles, Shotguns, Firearms (type unknown), Knives or cutting instruments, Other weapons	Hands, fists, feet, etc. You (the user) as you interact with the slideshow, you will quickly find out that Handguns and Firearms are among the deadliest in the US. Furthermore, you will see a trend in murders from 2016 to 2018 where crimes in the US continue to rise and the data will vary based on the population in each state. President Barack Obama was under pressure to tighten gun laws after following the disclosure by police that the Newtown gunman used a semi-automatic assault rifle equipped with "numerous" high-capacity magazines holding hundreds of bullets to carry out his massacre of young children. Unfortunately, Congress failed to act  and The National Rifle Association, the largest and most influential of the gun rights lobby groups, has been similarly silent after each massacre and the murder figures themselves are astounding for a country like the United Kingdom its used to around 550 murders per year. In 2018 - the latest year for which detailed statistics are available - there were 16,214 murders in the US. Of those, 8,583 were caused by firearms. The FBI crime statistics are based on reports to FBI bureau and local law enforcement. In conclusion, I am very passionate about the gun debate and this is why I chose this dataset in order to show that if we have that we need to have gun reforms in the US. This is not a matter of the second amendment rights but rather a matter of life and death.
